# Navigation Bar

There are 2 main parts of the navbar. A logo or brand link, and the navigations links. You can align these links to the left or right.

## Right Aligned Links

To right align your navbar links, just add a `right` class to the `ul` that contains them.

<Story of={stories.RightAligned} />
<Source of={stories.RightAligned} format="dedent"/>

## Left Aligned Links

<Story of={stories.LeftAligned} />
<Source of={stories.LeftAligned} format="dedent"/>
